# BigBox Trans-Generational Emulation Station

![BigBox Powered Station](BB.png)

**One gamepad. Four decades of games. Zero compromises.**
- **ðŸ“– [Jump to the full setup guide](emulation_station.md)** 

This project transforms a Windows PC into a unified emulation consoleâ€”boot straight into a gamepad-only interface spanning everything from 1980s arcade machines to modern Switch and Steam titles. No stretched pixels. No desktop clutter. Just the games, the way they were meant to be seen and played.

## Why It Exists

With the rise of high-quality HDMI scalers and CRT shader support, delivering original game resolutions is more desirable than everâ€”these devices achieve the best results when fed native signals.

Most emulation boxes cut cornersâ€”either sacrificing visual accuracy or ignoring modern systems. This build aims higher:

- **Native resolution output** (224pâ€“720p) via HDMI for pixel-perfect fidelity  
- **Gamepad-only operation** from boot to gameplay  
- **Support for rotated (TATE) and horizontal displays**  
- **Integration of standalone emulators + Steam via LaunchBox/BigBox**

Itâ€™s not just an emulation setup. Itâ€™s a reimagined console.
