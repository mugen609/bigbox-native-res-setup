![BigBox Powered Station](BB.png)

Welcome to the BigBox Trans-Generational Emulation Station, a project that unifies 40+ years of gaming—from 1980s arcade classics to modern Switch and Steam titles—into a console-like experience on Windows 10. This setup delivers pixel-perfect native resolutions (224p–720p) via HDMI to a compatible modern scaler, providing a gamepad-only interface, and standardized controls across everything. It supports horizontal and vertical (TATE) arcade games, running on any capable PC.

## About
This repository contains detailed documentation for building and configuring the emulation station, including hardware/software requirements, resolution setup, emulator configuration specifics, and workarounds for Windows limitations (e.g., controller reordering, popup dismissal). The goal is a seamless, couch-friendly emulation hub that feels like a premium retro console.
